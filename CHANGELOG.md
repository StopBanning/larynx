# Changelog

## 0.4.0 (Nov 11, 2026)

- **Liquid Glass pill:** one glass capsule with the icon of the app your words are going to, a waveform driven by
  your voice, and the words as you speak. It sits just above the text field you're dictating into, warns when the
  mic hears nothing, and shows a lock in password fields. `larynx pill-demo` plays it for screenshots.
- **History and crash recovery:** dictations are kept on your Mac for 30 days in SQLite with full-text search
  (`larynx history --search`). Each recording is written to disk before transcription, so a crash can't lose it:
  the next launch recovers it. Password fields and password managers are never stored; `history: off` stores
  nothing. Transcript text is out of the log by default. See [docs/PRIVACY.md](docs/PRIVACY.md).
- **Self-learning:** say a sentence again with a word fixed and Larynx learns the fix; edit a pasted word in place
  and it learns that too (now works in Messages and Claude). Menu: Undo Learned. `larynx mine` shows what your
  history would teach.
- **Foundations:** Swift Testing suite (29 tests), a portable text engine (`LarynxText`) that builds and passes on
  Windows and Linux in CI, a typed transcript and ordered pipeline with off/shadow/on stages, `settings.json` with
  live reload ([docs/SETTINGS.md](docs/SETTINGS.md)).
- **Fixes:** audio files no longer lose their last ~40 ms when transcribed from a file; the word list reads Windows
  line endings.
- **Windows:** feasibility proven in CI (text engine passes; Parakeet v3 runs on a Windows CPU at 0.15x real time).
  Plan in [docs/WINDOWS.md](docs/WINDOWS.md).

## 0.3.0 (Nov 8, 2026)

- Copy fallback: when no text field has focus, the text stays on the clipboard and the pill says so.
- Target lock: the app you started in gets the text, even if you switch apps mid-sentence.
- Second chance: an empty result from a clip with speech is retried with the other speech model.
- Live preview pill, MCP server (`larynx mcp`), vocabulary boosting from your project names, snippets, code by
  voice, menu bar settings, opens at login.

## 0.2.0 (Nov 8, 2026)

- Cleanup layers: the Bark 3.0 Clean speech model drops ums and false starts; tidy rules; an on-device AI rewrite
  (Apple Foundation Models) for self-corrections and numbers, only when needed and behind a guard.
- Per-app modes, personal dictionary, stable signing so rebuilds keep permissions, spoken test suite.

## 0.1.0 (Nov 8, 2026)

- Hold-to-talk dictation into any app with Parakeet TDT v3 on the Neural Engine; `transcribe`, `listen` and
  `serve` (JSON lines) commands.
